Shopping Cart Test Question Made in Ruby
## Brief Description
Program must scan and calculate items for sale including the discounts

CH1 - Chai - $3.11
AP1 - Apples - $6.00
CF1 - Coffee - $11.23
MK1 - Milk - $4.75

BOGO -- Buy-One-Get-One-Free Special on Coffee. (Unlimited)
APPL -- If you buy 3 or more bags of Apples, the price drops to $4.50.
CHMK -- Purchase a box of Chai and get milk free. (Limit 1)

There is a small custom CLI used to add items and scans. Plus I got bit crazy with the emojis ðŸ˜œ

## Start
```shell
ruby start_cli.rb
```
## Testing
```rspec```
